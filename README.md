I am William Herg√®s known as Anhgelus Morhtuuzh on Internet and in the French Minecraft community.

Old chief executive and lead developer from the biggest independant French Minecraft community based on Discord,
I am always working to create incredible tools and to push the boundaries of Minecraft events.

Currently, I am the lead developer of [La Fabrick](https://la-fabrick.eu) and the director of the [MSMP Project](https://github.com/msmp-mc).

I'm no longer interested in simple projects: I want real challenges like creating an maze generator or a compression algorithm.

My portfolio and CV are available [here](https://www.anhgelus.world/)
