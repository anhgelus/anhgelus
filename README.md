I am William Herg√®s known as Anhgelus Morhtuuzh on Internet and in the French Minecraft community.

I was the chief executive and lead developer from the biggest independant French Minecraft community based on Discord.

Currently, I have no project for a simple reason: I have been accepted in the CPES Sciences of Henri IV and PSL (one of France's toughest university courses)

I'm no longer interested to join any projects (math is better than computers).

My portfolio and CV are available [here](https://www.anhgelus.world/).

My blog is available [here](https://blog.anhgelus.world/) (French only).
